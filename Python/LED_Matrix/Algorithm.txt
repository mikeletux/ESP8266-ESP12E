Main
	Set HSPI and SPI to control shift registers SN74HC595
	Interrupt_variable -> False
	Shift_text_constant = 12 
	Shift_text_counter = 0 (Every time the screen needs to be refreshed, this will be increased by one. When Shift_text_constant is reached, text will shift one led column to the left.)
	Create screen object s
	s.fromStringToHexBuffer()
	Timer(20ms, fuction -> timer_handler)
	while True:
		if Interrupt_variable == True
			refresh_screen()
			Interrupt_variable = False
			if Shift_text_counter == Shift_text_constant
				s.shift_text()
				Shift_text_counter = 0
				
	function timer_handler()
		Interrupt_variable = True
		Shift_text_counter += 1
	

	
This algorithm will be much efficient using semaphores/mutex
